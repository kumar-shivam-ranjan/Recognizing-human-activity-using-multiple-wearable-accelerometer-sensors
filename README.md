### Human Activity Recognition, is the problem of predicting what kind of activity a person is performing based on a signals detected by smartphone sensors on their waist.
### Two types of sensors present in smartphones are:
### 1. Accelerometer
### 2. Gyroscope 
### Accelerometer measures acceleration and Gyroscope measures angular velocity.
